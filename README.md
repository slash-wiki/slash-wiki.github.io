## Who is this resource for?

This resource is aimed at beginners of the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com). The beginner focused guides from Slack are great if you are using JavaScript, PHP, Python or Java but have gaps if you are't familiar with or using those languages.

## How to use this resource?

This resource is going to cover two ways to interact with the Slack slash command API: traditional Rest APIs and Lambda functions. 

Please choose a protocol and a language:

| Rest API                         | Lambda Functions                   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| [Go](rest/go.md)                 | [Go](lambda/go.md)                 |

Please don't hesitate to open [an issue](https://github.com/they-them/slash-wiki/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/slash-wiki/slash-wiki.github.io/compare) if you wish to add additional languages.
